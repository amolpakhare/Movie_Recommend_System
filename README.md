Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This is a movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques and Python libraries such Scikit-learn & NLTK. The system provides recommendations based on user preferences. Its recommend top five movie. Which is similar to the input. Additionally, a web interface is implemented using the Streamlit library, making it easy for users to interact with the model.
Features
•	Movie recommendations based on user input.
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using NLTK.
•	Interactive web interface using Streamlit.
•	Uses IMDB dataset for movie recommendations.
